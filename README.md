# Cake Recipe App Using React and API

## Project Brief
I created this app as one of my weekend assignments while studying at CodeClan after a couple of weeks of learning Javascript. The project brief was to use an external API to display some information for the user to interact with. I used a recipe API and focussed on cake recipes. 

## Technologies Used
This app is written in Javascript and uses the React framework.

## Functionality
The homepage displays a list of available recipes fetched by the API. The user can either select a recipe from the dropdown list or click on the icon to display the recipe. The user can add the recipe to their favourites, which is saved in local storage. 
The app also uses routing to display an "About" page.
